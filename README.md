The-LED-heart-_-Arduino

On a 8X8 LED dot matrix,we display a heart with the help of an Arduino Uno.

//the project 

On a 8x8 LED dot matrix we display a heart image (which is created by the matrix's dots/LEDs that are ON).
We wait for 5 seconds and then booom!, the leds that compose the heart turn on and a heart can be seen on
the matrix.
We keep the heart image on the matrix for 15 seconds and then we turn it off.
